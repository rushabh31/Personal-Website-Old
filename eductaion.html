            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="display: justify;">I am currently working as a Data Scientist in Analytics and Data Science department of a non-profit organization called Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY). I am responsible to design statistical algorithms using different programming languages to successfully test hypotheses and answer targeted questions in healthcare outcomes research. I am currently working on a project to predict mortality outcome for a home health care population. Prior to this job, I worked almost 2 years for a AI healthcare startup company called Jvion, which is based in Atlanta GA. I worked there as a Data Scientist in Research & Development department where, I was responsible to design algorithms for the recommended actions/interventions that will best prevent adverse events and deterioration for a patient population. I have also done cluster analysis for identifying sub-populations of complex patients who may benefit from targeted care management strategies and improvising positive predicted value for patient outcome by sub-modelling on each cluster. I also build algorithms to reduce predictive analytics in driving population-level insights and the expected ROI from predictive population health analytic solutions. The health outcomes on which I was working includes hospital readmission among Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients, IP visits, ER visits, MRSA among diabetes patients, congestive heart failure, Clostridium difficile (C. diff.), pressure injury, sepsis and fall-injury.</p>
